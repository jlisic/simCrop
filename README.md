Crop Simulation and Tools

This is a simple tool in R that is being used for my dissertation.  The functions
are generally static, but the slower items such as the smoothing function will be replaced
with C code.

TODO:

1.  move the simulation specific code out of simCrop.R into a new file sim.R
2.  add snow/rmpi code for the simulation component
